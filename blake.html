    <p>William Blake (1757–1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker who is now considered one of the greatest figures of the Romantic Age. He was not very famous during his lifetime, but later people admired his powerful imagination and unique style. Blake wrote many famous works such as Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, which show two different views of life — the purity of childhood and the struggles of adulthood. He also created “illuminated books,” where he combined his poetry with beautiful hand-colored illustrations. Blake believed strongly in the power of imagination and often criticized the strict rules of society and religion. Today, he is remembered as both a visionary poet and an artist who inspired generations with his creative and spiritual ideas.William Blake was an English poet, painter, and printmaker who lived from 1757 to 1827. He is known for his powerful imagination and unique artistic style. His famous works include Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, where he showed the contrast between the innocence of childhood and the reality of adult life. Blake also created beautiful illustrations for his poems, making his work very special. Though not very popular in his lifetime, today he is remembered as one of the greatest Romantic poets and artists.</p>

    
    <p>Blake’s poetry is well known for its deep symbolism and spiritual themes. His most famous works, Songs of Innocence (1789) and Songs of Experience (1794), explore two contrasting states of human existence. The poems in Innocence capture the purity and joy of childhood, while those in Experience reflect the harsh realities of life and the struggles of adulthood. Together, they show how innocence can be lost but also transformed by wisdom. His other works, such as The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and Jerusalem, reveal his radical ideas about religion, society, and human freedom.

In addition to poetry, William Blake was also a remarkable artist. He invented a unique method called “illuminated printing,” where he combined his poems with detailed hand-colored illustrations. His artwork is filled with powerful images of angels, biblical stories, and mythological figures. Paintings like The Ancient of Days and his series The Great Red Dragon show his visionary imagination and continue to inspire artists today.

Blake strongly believed in the power of imagination over reason. He often criticized the strict rules of society and organized religion, which he felt limited human creativity and freedom. For him, true truth and beauty came from inner vision and spiritual experience. Because of these bold ideas, many of his works were not understood in his lifetime, but later generations recognized his genius.</p>
